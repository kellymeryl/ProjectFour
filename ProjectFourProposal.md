# Project Four Proposal

### Objectives
My overall objective for this project is to create an app that allows a user to utilize their fitbit to track their sleep and record notes along with their sleep log with a clean, user friendly experience.  I am solving the problem of the lack of apps on the market that allow a user to solely track their sleep and their corresponding dreams.  The user goals I am trying to make possible are attaining an accurate depiction of how a user sleeps, allowing a user to track their dreams and associate their dreams with their insomnia and general sleep patterns, and allow a user to go back and see their sleep and notes from previous logged days.

### Takeaways from Research Findings
I've found that there are no apps on the market that solely allow you to use fitbit to track your sleep and view your sleep patterns in a simple, clean, user friendly manner.  There is also only one app that allows you to take notes to go along with your nights of sleep, but the app has a difficult UX and makes it difficult to find how to view sleep logs days later.

### Target Audience
My target audience is individuals who use a fitbit and are looking for a way to keep track of their sleep and their dreams.

### Features
Features I will include are a table view for viewing notes of previous days, potentially a calendar view to view previous days sleep, some sort of graph integration to depict how a user slept the night before and tab views for every feature.

### Differentiation from Competitors
Pain points being addressed are creating a simple app that focuses on tracking sleep and tracking dreams without complicating the app with other features such as meditation, etc.

### Constraints
Timing is a large constraint as well as the fact that I'm working with only the sleep parameters that Fitbit provides.

### Why was this an app instead of a website?
This is an app instead of a website because it is a quick and easy way for individuals to grab their phone before and after bed and get an understanding of their sleep patterns as well as their dream patterns.  The fact that most individuals sleep with their phones near them makes this a good app to make, because the individual will have access to this app immediately before and immediately after sleep.
