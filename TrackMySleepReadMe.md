#Track My Sleep

Track my sleep is an application that allows a user to track various aspects of their sleep cycles by connecting this app to Fitbit.  The first thing the user does is connect the app to Fitbit.  After the user connects to Fitbit, the app opens to a tab view.  The opening screen of the tab view is a screen that shows the user various aspects (efficiency, duration and date) of their previous nights sleep.  The user can than click on one of these table view cells to open a detail page.  The detail page shows a graph that analyses sleep based on awake, restless, and sleeping over a period of time. The detail page also shows a collection view of all of the sleep elements that Fitbit tracks.

On the detail page, a user can click add note.  The notes function allows a user to create a dream diary associated with various days.  These days are recorded in a notes array that displays in a table view under the "notes" tab of the tab view.  The notes are persisted on Firebase and stored according to each day.  A user can add and delete notes as they please.
