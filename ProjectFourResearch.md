# Project Four Research 

##Research Plan Worksheet
1. Title: Insomnia App Questionairre/Research Plan
2. Authors and Stakeholders: Myself, Kelly McNevin, kelly.mcnevin@gmail.com
3. Date: January 30th, 2017
4. Background: Having insomnia myself, I am interested to study how individuals would use a sleep tracking app that allowed them to track their insomnia using a fitbit as well as whether individuals would be interested in tracking their dreams, etc. from the previous night.
5. Goals: To get an understanding of consumer needs to enhance the app development process.
6. Research Questions:
	(1) Would you be interested in tracking your sleep? 	(2) Do you have a fitbit? (3) Would you be interested in tracking your dreams? (4) Do you already track your sleep / dreams? (5) Do you use any fitness/sleep monitoring apps already?
7. Methodology: This will be a quick questionairre where I will ask the questions and record the answers.
8. Participants: Individuals who own a fitness who are interested in tracking their sleep patterns.
9. Schedule: January 29th, 2017: When the participant recruiting starts, January 30th 2017: When the study will take place, January 30th, 2017: When there will be results.
10. Topics and questions I want to learn about my audience: 1- Demographic: Where are you from? 2- Age: What age range are you in (teens, early 20s, late 20s, etc.), 3- Sleep patterns: Do you have insomnia, etc.? 4- Average sleep: How many hours of sleep a night do you get? 5- Fitness tracking patterns: Do you own a fitbit or track your fitness on an app? 

## User Stories
### 1. Fitness Frank: 
Fitness Frank lives in NYC, has a fitbit, and is obsessed with fitness.  Fitness Frank works out at least 5 days a week, and uses various apps to track his workout habits as well as his eating habits.  He uses his fitbit to track his sleeping habits, but he doesn't have an app that allows him to solely track his sleeping patterns and how many hours a night he sleeps.  He is looking for an app that allows him to utilize his fitbit to track his sleep in order to stay healthy.  His goal is to get a healthy 7 hours a night, and have an app that allows him to track that and reward him the same way fitness goal tracking apps work.

### 2. Sleepless Sarah: 
Sleepless Sarah lives in Atlanta, has a fitbit, and has insomnia.  She has tried everything, and has found that logging her sleep as well as her dreams is the most efficient way to track her sleeping habits.  She has meditation apps that allow her to help fall asleep, but she doesn't have an app that allows her to track her sleep the same way some apps allow her to use her fitbit to track how far she walks or how many calories she eats.  Her goal is to keep track of when she sleeps well and when she sleeps poorly, and allow her to log these daily along with notes in order to look back and understand the circumstances under which she sleeps well and the circumstances under which her insomnia prevails. 

## Competitive Analysis

## Problem Statement
1. How might we: How might we track how an individual sleeps throughout the night?
2. How might we: How might we allow an individual to log their dreams while tracking their sleep and save that log so an individual can go back and view them weeks later?
3. How might we: How might we allow an individual to see a visual representation of their sleep patterns based on their fitbit information?
4. Problem Statement: Users need a way to track how they sleep, view their sleep patterns, and track their dreams, because insomnia and sleep deprivation should be as easily accessible to track as calories and steps via Fitbit.
5. Hypothesis: I believe that by creating an app that allows a user to track sleep, sleep patterns, and log dreams, I will achieve the outcome of allowing a user to have better insight into their sleep and therefore sleep better.
6. I will know this is true when I have users using my app with their Fitbit.

## Prioritized Features
1. Clean, user friendly user interface.
2. Utilization of a login home screen page.
3. Utilization of o-auth so a user can authorize their log in with their fitbit login.
4. Home page featuring a welcome page and tab views.
5. Utilization of a table view or calendar for past sleep logs.
6. Utilization of a sleep page that shows a user's sleep patterns based on information provided by their Fitbit.
7. Utilization of a notes page that stores the user's notes locally.
